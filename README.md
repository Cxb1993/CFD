Texts - theory and tutorials - on fluid flow mathematical and numerical
modeling.
This repository starts with a theorical view on the mathematical modeling of incompressible fluid flow in an open channel, 
both in laminar and turbulent regimes.

Compilation instructions:

Simply use 'make' to compile latex files.

make: compile main file turning into main.pdf
make clean: remove unnecessary files, leaving main.pdf in the directory
make deepclean: remove all files produced by make, including main.pdf
